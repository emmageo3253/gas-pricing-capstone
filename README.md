# gas-pricing-capstone
This project analyzes gasoline pricing behavior using station-level panel data integrated from multiple APIs. The goal is to evaluate how local competition and demand composition influence price volatility, adjustment frequency, and strategic pricing behavior.

The analysis focuses on building structured datasets from messy external data sources and translating complex pricing patterns into actionable insight.

# Objectives
- Integreate API-based fuel pricing data into a clean panel dataset  
- Engineer geospatial competition metrics within a defined radius  
- Calculate weekly price volatility and adjustment frequenct  
- Evaluate how local market structure influences pricing behavior  
- Develop reproducible workflows for scalable analysis  

# Tools
- Python/Idle  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- requests (API Integration)
